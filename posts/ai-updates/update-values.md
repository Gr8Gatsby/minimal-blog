Navigating the complex world of leadership can be daunting, especially when striving to maintain a strong focus on core values amidst the daily rush of emails, meetings, and deadlines. It's easy to get lost in the shuffle, but the essence of effective leadership lies significantly in two core areas: self-awareness and team values.

Let's delve into how cultivating these aspects can significantly enhance your leadership effectiveness and foster a deeply cohesive team environment.

### Understanding the Importance of Self-Awareness

Self-awareness in leadership acts as a compass. It helps leaders to navigate their roles with clarity and authenticity, acknowledging their strengths and areas for improvement. My journey into enhancing this skill took a pivotal turn upon reading Claire Hughes-Johnson’s book, *[Scaling People: Tactics for Management and Company Building](https://www.amazon.com/Scaling-People-Tactics-Management-Building/dp/1953953212)*. Her insights on assessing values and self-awareness inspired a transformative exercise within my team.

**Practical Application**: We developed a value-assessment template, inspired by both Claire’s book and Colin Breck's impactful article. This tool was instrumental in our team’s project, aiming to [assess our core values](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rmp7P-qzJ6gsXrYbxMJaHS8fRhdUmrabFsoUPmEPveQ/pub) and align our actions and decisions with them.

### Assessing Team Values

The importance of understanding both personal and team values cannot be understated. Research from sources like *[Harvard Business](https://www.harvardbusiness.org/the-ladder-of-inference-building-self-awareness-to-be-a-better-human-centered-leader/)* and *[Knowledge at Wharton](https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/podcast/knowledge-at-wharton-podcast/self-awareness-key-to-more-effective-team-discussions/)* consistently highlights the direct impact of shared values on decision-making, communication, and collaboration. Moreover, aligning individual team members with roles and projects that reflect their values leads to increased job satisfaction and enhanced performance.

### Real-Life Application and Results

Implementing the values-assessment framework was eye-opening. A year after integrating this practice, our team revisited our values. While our foundational principles remained intact, the refresh allowed us to celebrate milestones, realign our activities, and openly discuss necessary compromises.

The long-term benefits have been clear: strengthened trust and a dynamic team aligned not just by tasks but by shared values and goals. This process correlates closely with findings from the *[APA](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2018/09/cover-teams)*, which underscores the effectiveness of such team-building exercises.

### Call to Action

Reflect on the current state of your team. How well do you and your colleagues understand and embody your core values? Are you ready to deepen your team's cohesion and effectiveness through enhanced self-awareness and value alignment?

Embark on this journey today, and see the transformative impact it can have not just on your leadership but on your entire team's dynamics.
