# Ditch the Scroll. Pick Up a Book. Change Your Brain.

Let’s be honest—how often do we reach for our phones just to *fill time*? 

- Waiting in line? Scroll.  
- Bored on the couch? Scroll.  
- Settling into bed? Scroll until we pass out.  


I found myself constantly scrolling through Instagram stories in the morning when I woke up to start my day, sometimes this would even dely me starting my day.

The problem isn’t just the time we lose—it’s the way scrolling *shapes* our thinking. Social media and endless feeds serve up pre-packaged content, requiring nothing from us except passive consumption. It’s quick, easy, and addicting.  

But reading? Reading *demands* something different. It challenges our minds, sparks our imagination, and engages us in ways that scrolling never will.

Having a little inpiration from [@Stefanie Stimac](https://www.threads.net/@stephanie.m.stimac) and her regular posts about reading. I was inspired with one comment she made about reading instead of scrolling. 

## Your Brain on Reading vs. Your Brain on Scrolling  

If you think the benefits of reading are just *nostalgic book-lover talk*, think again. Studies prove that reading doesn’t just entertain us—it fundamentally changes the way our brains work.  

🧘‍♂️ **Reduces stress** – Reading for just six minutes can lower stress levels by 68%, making it more effective than listening to music or drinking tea [[The Argus]](https://www.theargus.co.uk/news/4245076.reading-can-help-reduce-stress-according-to-university-of-sussex-research/) .  

🧠 **Improves focus & memory** – Unlike scrolling, which scatters attention and shortens our ability to concentrate, reading strengthens neural connections, helping us retain information and focus better over time [[Healthline]](https://www.healthline.com/health/benefits-of-reading-books).  

💖 **Boosts empathy** – Fiction readers are better at understanding emotions and interpreting social situations, making them more empathetic in real life [[Healthline]](https://www.healthline.com/health/benefits-of-reading-books).  

⏳ **Increases lifespan** – People who read books regularly have a 20% lower mortality risk compared to non-readers. Reading literally helps you live longer [[Social Science & Medicine]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5105607/).  

Yet, most of us still default to screens instead of books. Why? Because reading requires *effort*. And we’ve become more used to consuming pre-made content that is easier load on our brains. 

## Watching vs. Imagining: The Passive vs. Active Mind  

Scrolling feeds us fully formed images and narratives, designed to be consumed without thought. Every second, a new video, a new meme, a new perfectly curated aesthetic. Our brains don’t *create* anything—they just react.  

Reading, on the other hand, is active. A book hands you words, but *you* have to turn those words into images. *You* have to visualize the character’s face, hear their voice, and imagine the setting. This isn’t just more engaging—it strengthens creativity, memory, and cognitive flexibility.  

When you watch a movie, you’re seeing someone else’s interpretation of a story. When you read a book, you *build* the world yourself.  

## Why I Read on Flights Instead of Watching Movies  

One of the best places to notice the difference between *passive* and *active* consumption is on a long flight.  

I always see the same thing: rows of passengers locked into their screens, bingeing movie after movie, unable to sleep. By the time we land, they look drained—zoned out, overstimulated, and exhausted.  

Meanwhile, reading on a flight does the opposite. It keeps my mind engaged but not overwhelmed. It helps me relax. And most of the time, I actually end up *falling asleep*—naturally, not from sheer screen fatigue.  

This isn’t an anti-movie argument (I love a good film). But when every spare moment is filled with passive consumption, we lose something. We lose creativity, focus, and the ability to sit with our own thoughts.  

## Read, Share, Repeat: The Power of Passing on a Book  

Recently, I finished a John Grisham book and, instead of letting it collect dust, I mailed it to a friend with a handwritten note encouraging her to read it.  

<div class="image-row">
  <a href="{{ baseUrl }}assets/images/ditch-the-scroll/sharing-books.jpg" target="_blank" class="image-container">
    <img src="{{ baseUrl }}assets/images/ditch-the-scroll/sharing-books.jpg" alt="The Exchange a book by John Grisham with a hand written note" class="inline-image">
  </a>
</div>

Why? Because books aren’t just *things*—they’re experiences. They deserve to be passed on.  

In an era where interactions are reduced to likes and comments, handing someone a book is a rare, personal gesture. It’s an invitation to unplug, slow down, and engage with something real.  

## Your Turn: Make the Swap  

I’m not saying *never* scroll. But I am saying **be intentional** about what you feed your mind.  

### Here’s the challenge:  

📖 **Read instead of scrolling** – Even just 10 minutes a day. Start small.  
🎁 **Pass along a book you love** – Write a note. Make it personal.  
📬 **Got a great book? Send it my way!** – I’m always open to my next read.  

Your brain deserves more than an algorithm-curated feed. Give it something real.
