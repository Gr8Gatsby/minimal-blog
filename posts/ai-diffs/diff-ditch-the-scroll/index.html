<p>I found myself constantly scrolling through**(ADDED)**</p>
<p>My mornings were once hostage to Instagram stories**(REMOVED)**  in the morning when I woke up to start my day, <strong>(REMOVED)</strong> sometimes this would even dely me starting**(ADDED)** which frequently delayed my day**(ADDED)** 's start.

<p>Conversely, reading <strong>(REMOVED)</strong> ? Reading <em>demands</em>*(REMOVED)** * something different.

<p>Yet, most of us still**(ADDED)**</p>
<p>Many default to screens <strong>(REMOVED)</strong> instead of**(ADDED)** rather than books**(REMOVED)** . Why?

<h2><strong>(REMOVED)</strong> Watching**(ADDED)** Passive vs. <strong>(REMOVED)</strong> Imagining**(ADDED)** Active Engagement: <strong>(REMOVED)</strong> The Passive**(ADDED)** Consuming vs. <strong>(REMOVED)</strong> Active Mind  <strong>(ADDED)</strong> Creating</h2>
<p>Scrolling <strong>(REMOVED)</strong> feeds us fully formed**(ADDED)** presents ready-made images and <strong>(REMOVED)</strong> narratives, designed to be consumed without thought**(ADDED)** storylines that demand little from us but passive consumption. <strong>(REMOVED)</strong> Every second, a new video, a new meme, a new perfectly curated aesthetic. Our brains don**(REMOVED)** ‚Äô<strong>(ADDED)</strong> 't <strong>(REMOVED)</strong> <em>create</em>*(REMOVED)** * anything‚Äî<strong>(ADDED)</strong> ; they <strong>(REMOVED)</strong> just**(ADDED)** merely react <strong>(ADDED)</strong> to the constant flow of prefabricated content. <strong>(REMOVED)</strong></p>
<p>Reading**(ADDED)**</p>
<p>In contrast, <strong>(REMOVED)</strong> on the other hand,<strong>(ADDED)</strong> reading is <strong>(ADDED)</strong> inherently active. A book <strong>(REMOVED)</strong> hands**(ADDED)** gives you words**(REMOVED)** , but <em><strong>(ADDED)</strong>  which you</em>*(REMOVED)** * have to turn those words**(ADDED)**  transform into <strong>(ADDED)</strong> vibrant images**(REMOVED)** . <em>You</em> have to visualize the character‚Äôs face, <strong>(REMOVED)</strong> hear their voice**(ADDED)** voices, and <strong>(REMOVED)</strong> imagine the setting**(ADDED)** worlds. <strong>(REMOVED)</strong> This isn**(ADDED)** It‚Äô<strong>(REMOVED)</strong> t just**(ADDED)** s not only more <strong>(REMOVED)</strong> engaging‚Äîit**(ADDED)** immersive but also strengthens <strong>(ADDED)</strong> your creativity, memory, and cognitive flexibility**(ADDED)** ‚Äîthe brain's ability to adapt to new psychological processes.<strong>(REMOVED)</strong></p>

<p>Films display a <strong>(REMOVED)</strong> movie, you**(ADDED)** director‚Äô<strong>(REMOVED)</strong> re seeing someone else‚Äôs <strong>(REMOVED)</strong> interpretation**(ADDED)** vision of a story. <strong>(REMOVED)</strong> When you read a book**(ADDED)** Books, <strong>(ADDED)</strong> however, let you <strong>(REMOVED)</strong> <em>build</em>*(REMOVED)** <em><strong>(ADDED)</strong>  and perceive the world <strong>(REMOVED)</strong> yourself</em>*(ADDED)** through your own imaginative process.</p>
<h2><strong>(REMOVED)</strong> Why I Read**(ADDED)** Personal Experience: Reading Over Movies on Flights**(REMOVED)**  Instead of Watching Movies</h2>
<p>One of**(ADDED)**</p>
<p>Long flights exemplify the <strong>(REMOVED)</strong> best places to notice the difference between <strong>(REMOVED)</strong> <em>passive</em>*(REMOVED)** * and <strong>(REMOVED)</strong> <em>active</em>*(REMOVED)** * consumption**(REMOVED)**  is on a long flight. I**(REMOVED)**  always see the same thing: rows of**(ADDED)** ‚Äôve noticed fellow passengers <strong>(REMOVED)</strong> locked into their screens**(ADDED)** binge-watching films, <strong>(REMOVED)</strong> bingeing movie after movie, unable to sleep. By the time we land, they look drained‚Äîzoned out, overstimulated, and**(ADDED)** often disembarking looking exhausted <strong>(ADDED)</strong> and overstimulated.<strong>(REMOVED)</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile**(ADDED)**</p>
<p>Choosing to read, <strong>(REMOVED)</strong> reading on a flight does the opposite. It keeps**(ADDED)** alternatively, maintains my <strong>(REMOVED)</strong> mind engaged but not overwhelmed. It helps**(ADDED)** engagement without overwhelming me**(REMOVED)**  relax. <strong>(REMOVED)</strong> And most of the time,<strong>(ADDED)</strong> It's relaxing and often I <strong>(REMOVED)</strong> actually end up <em><strong>(ADDED)</strong> find myself naturally falling asleep</em>*(REMOVED)** <em>‚Äînaturally</em>*(ADDED)**  refreshed, not <strong>(REMOVED)</strong> from sheer**(ADDED)** fatigued by screen <strong>(REMOVED)</strong> fatigue**(ADDED)** glare.<strong>(REMOVED)</strong></p>
<p>This isn‚Äôt an anti-movie argument (I love a good film). But when every spare moment is filled with passive consumption, we lose something. We lose creativity, focus, and the ability to sit with our own thoughts.</p>

<p>After enjoying a <strong>(REMOVED)</strong> Book</p>

<p>This act of passing on a book <strong>(REMOVED)</strong> by John Grisham with**(ADDED)** is a <strong>(REMOVED)</strong> hand written note&quot; class=&quot;inline-image&quot;&gt;
</a></p>
</div>
<p>Why? Because books aren‚Äôt just <em>things</em>‚Äîthey‚Äôre experiences. They deserve to be passed on.</p>
<p>In an era where**(ADDED)** personal, thoughtful exchange, contrasting sharply with the impersonal interactions <strong>(REMOVED)</strong> are reduced to**(ADDED)** of likes and comments**(REMOVED)** , handing someone a book is a rare, personal gesture**(ADDED)**  online.

<p>I‚Äôm not saying <em>never</em> scroll. But I am saying <strong>be intentional</strong> about what you feed your mind.</p>

<p>üìñ <strong>Read instead of</strong>(ADDED)**</p>
<p>Swap scrolling**(REMOVED)** ** ‚Äì Even**(ADDED)**  for reading, even if it's just <strong>(REMOVED)</strong> 10**(ADDED)** for ten minutes a day. <strong>(REMOVED)</strong> Start**(ADDED)** Begin with small <strong>(ADDED)</strong> steps:</p>
