# Ditch the Scroll. Pick Up a Book. **(REMOVED)** Change**(ADDED)** Transform Your **(REMOVED)** Brain**(ADDED)** Mind.

**(REMOVED)** Let**(ADDED)** It‚Äôs **(REMOVED)** be honest‚Äîhow often do we**(ADDED)** alarmingly easy to reach for our phones **(REMOVED)** just to **(ADDED)** simply *fill time***(REMOVED)** ? 
**(ADDED)** :
- Waiting in line? Scroll.

- **(REMOVED)** Settling into bed**(ADDED)** Can‚Äôt sleep? Scroll until we pass out.**(REMOVED)**   


I found myself constantly scrolling through**(ADDED)** 

My mornings were once hostage to Instagram stories**(REMOVED)**  in the morning when I woke up to start my day, **(REMOVED)** sometimes this would even dely me starting**(ADDED)** which frequently delayed my day**(ADDED)** 's start. The **(REMOVED)** problem isn‚Äôt just the**(ADDED)** issue extends beyond lost time**(REMOVED)**  we lose‚Äîit**(REMOVED)** ‚Äô**(ADDED)** 's **(REMOVED)** the way**(ADDED)** about how mindless scrolling **(REMOVED)** *shapes***(ADDED)** molds our **(REMOVED)** thinking**(ADDED)** thoughts. Social media **(REMOVED)** and endless feeds serve up pre**(ADDED)** delivers bite-**(REMOVED)** packaged**(ADDED)** sized content**(REMOVED)** , requiring **(REMOVED)** nothing from us except passive consumption. It‚Äôs **(ADDED)** minimal thought‚Äîquick, easy, and **(REMOVED)** addicting**(ADDED)** addictive.**(REMOVED)**

Conversely, reading **(REMOVED)** ? Reading *demands**(REMOVED)** * something different. It challenges**(ADDED)**  active engagement from us, challenging our **(REMOVED)** minds**(ADDED)** brains, **(REMOVED)** sparks**(ADDED)** igniting our **(REMOVED)** imagination**(ADDED)** imaginations, and **(REMOVED)** engages**(ADDED)** intriguing us in ways **(REMOVED)** that scrolling **(REMOVED)** never will**(ADDED)** can't match.**(REMOVED)**

## Your Brain on **(REMOVED)** Reading**(ADDED)** Books vs. Your Brain on **(REMOVED)** Scrolling  

If you think**(ADDED)** Screens

Forget the **(REMOVED)** benefits**(ADDED)** notion that the advantages of reading are **(REMOVED)** just**(ADDED)** mere ***(REMOVED)** nostalgic**(ADDED)** nostalgia for book-**(REMOVED)** lover talk**(ADDED)** lovers***(REMOVED)** , think again. **(REMOVED)** Studies prove**(ADDED)** Research consistently shows that reading **(REMOVED)** doesn‚Äôt just entertain us‚Äîit fundamentally changes the way**(ADDED)** can revolutionize our **(REMOVED)** brains work.  **(ADDED)** mental operations:

üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ****(REMOVED)** Reduces stress**(ADDED)** Stress Reduction****(REMOVED)**  ‚Äì Reading for just**(ADDED)** : Just six minutes **(ADDED)** of reading can **(REMOVED)** lower**(ADDED)** slash stress levels by 68%, **(REMOVED)** making it more effective than**(ADDED)** surpassing the effects of listening to music or **(REMOVED)** drinking**(ADDED)** sipping tea**(REMOVED)**  [[The Argus]](https://www.theargus.co.uk/news/4245076.reading-can-help-reduce-stress-**(ADDED)** , according **(REMOVED)** -to**(REMOVED)** -university-**(ADDED)**  University of**(REMOVED)** -sussex-**(ADDED)**  Sussex research**(REMOVED)** /) .

üß† ****(REMOVED)** Improves focus**(ADDED)** Enhanced Focus & **(REMOVED)** memory**(ADDED)** Memory****(REMOVED)**  ‚Äì Unlike**(ADDED)** : While scrolling**(REMOVED)** , which scatters**(ADDED)**  fragments our attention**(REMOVED)**  and shortens**(ADDED)** , reducing our **(REMOVED)** ability to concentrate**(ADDED)** focus span, reading strengthens neural **(REMOVED)** connections**(ADDED)** pathways, helping us **(ADDED)** maintain concentration and retain information **(REMOVED)** and focus better over time [[**(ADDED)** longer, as outlined by Healthline**(REMOVED)** ]](https://www.**(REMOVED)** healthline.com/health/benefits-of-reading-books).  

üíñ ****(REMOVED)** Boosts empathy**(ADDED)** Empathy Boost****(REMOVED)**  ‚Äì Fiction**(ADDED)** : Frequent readers **(REMOVED)** are**(ADDED)** of fiction exhibit greater empathy, better at understanding emotions and interpreting social **(REMOVED)** situations**(ADDED)** cues, **(REMOVED)** making them more empathetic in**(ADDED)** which translates into improved real**(ADDED)** -life **(REMOVED)** [[Healthline]](https://www**(ADDED)** social interactions.**(REMOVED)** healthline.com/health/benefits-of-reading-books).  

‚è≥ ****(REMOVED)** Increases lifespan**(ADDED)** Longevity****(REMOVED)**  ‚Äì People who read**(ADDED)** : Engaging with books **(REMOVED)** regularly have**(ADDED)** has been linked to a 20% **(REMOVED)** lower**(ADDED)** reduction in mortality risk **(REMOVED)** compared to non-**(ADDED)** over twelve years among regular readers**(REMOVED)** . Reading literally helps**(ADDED)** , suggesting that reading may actually help you live longer**(REMOVED)**  [[Social Science & Medicine]](https://pmc.**(REMOVED)** ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5105607/).  

Yet, most of us still**(ADDED)** 

Many default to screens **(REMOVED)** instead of**(ADDED)** rather than books**(REMOVED)** . Why? Because**(ADDED)**  primarily because reading requires **(REMOVED)** ***(ADDED)** more mental effort**(REMOVED)** *. **(REMOVED)** And we‚Äôve become more used to consuming pre-made content that**(ADDED)** However, the payoff from this effort is **(REMOVED)** easier load on our brains**(ADDED)** substantial in enhancing mental agility and overall well-being.

## **(REMOVED)** Watching**(ADDED)** Passive vs. **(REMOVED)** Imagining**(ADDED)** Active Engagement: **(REMOVED)** The Passive**(ADDED)** Consuming vs. **(REMOVED)** Active Mind  **(ADDED)** Creating

Scrolling **(REMOVED)** feeds us fully formed**(ADDED)** presents ready-made images and **(REMOVED)** narratives, designed to be consumed without thought**(ADDED)** storylines that demand little from us but passive consumption. **(REMOVED)** Every second, a new video, a new meme, a new perfectly curated aesthetic. Our brains don**(REMOVED)** ‚Äô**(ADDED)** 't **(REMOVED)** *create**(REMOVED)** * anything‚Äî**(ADDED)** ; they **(REMOVED)** just**(ADDED)** merely react **(ADDED)** to the constant flow of prefabricated content. **(REMOVED)**  

Reading**(ADDED)** 

In contrast, **(REMOVED)** on the other hand,**(ADDED)** reading is **(ADDED)** inherently active. A book **(REMOVED)** hands**(ADDED)** gives you words**(REMOVED)** , but ***(ADDED)**  which you**(REMOVED)** * have to turn those words**(ADDED)**  transform into **(ADDED)** vibrant images**(REMOVED)** . *You* have to visualize the character‚Äôs face, **(REMOVED)** hear their voice**(ADDED)** voices, and **(REMOVED)** imagine the setting**(ADDED)** worlds. **(REMOVED)** This isn**(ADDED)** It‚Äô**(REMOVED)** t just**(ADDED)** s not only more **(REMOVED)** engaging‚Äîit**(ADDED)** immersive but also strengthens **(ADDED)** your creativity, memory, and cognitive flexibility**(ADDED)** ‚Äîthe brain's ability to adapt to new psychological processes.**(REMOVED)**   

When you watch**(ADDED)** 

Films display a **(REMOVED)** movie, you**(ADDED)** director‚Äô**(REMOVED)** re seeing someone else‚Äôs **(REMOVED)** interpretation**(ADDED)** vision of a story. **(REMOVED)** When you read a book**(ADDED)** Books, **(ADDED)** however, let you **(REMOVED)** *build**(REMOVED)** ***(ADDED)**  and perceive the world **(REMOVED)** yourself**(ADDED)** through your own imaginative process.

## **(REMOVED)** Why I Read**(ADDED)** Personal Experience: Reading Over Movies on Flights**(REMOVED)**  Instead of Watching Movies  

One of**(ADDED)** 

Long flights exemplify the **(REMOVED)** best places to notice the difference between **(REMOVED)** *passive**(REMOVED)** * and **(REMOVED)** *active**(REMOVED)** * consumption**(REMOVED)**  is on a long flight. I**(REMOVED)**  always see the same thing: rows of**(ADDED)** ‚Äôve noticed fellow passengers **(REMOVED)** locked into their screens**(ADDED)** binge-watching films, **(REMOVED)** bingeing movie after movie, unable to sleep. By the time we land, they look drained‚Äîzoned out, overstimulated, and**(ADDED)** often disembarking looking exhausted **(ADDED)** and overstimulated.**(REMOVED)**   

Meanwhile**(ADDED)** 

Choosing to read, **(REMOVED)** reading on a flight does the opposite. It keeps**(ADDED)** alternatively, maintains my **(REMOVED)** mind engaged but not overwhelmed. It helps**(ADDED)** engagement without overwhelming me**(REMOVED)**  relax. **(REMOVED)** And most of the time,**(ADDED)** It's relaxing and often I **(REMOVED)** actually end up ***(ADDED)** find myself naturally falling asleep**(REMOVED)** *‚Äînaturally**(ADDED)**  refreshed, not **(REMOVED)** from sheer**(ADDED)** fatigued by screen **(REMOVED)** fatigue**(ADDED)** glare.**(REMOVED)**   

This isn‚Äôt an anti-movie argument (I love a good film). But when every spare moment is filled with passive consumption, we lose something. We lose creativity, focus, and the ability to sit with our own thoughts.  

## **(REMOVED)** Read, Share, Repeat: The **(REMOVED)** Power**(ADDED)** Joy of **(REMOVED)** Passing on**(ADDED)** Sharing Books

After enjoying a **(REMOVED)** Book  

Recently, I finished a John Grisham **(REMOVED)** book and**(ADDED)** novel, **(REMOVED)** instead of**(ADDED)** rather than letting it **(REMOVED)** collect**(ADDED)** gather dust, I **(REMOVED)** mailed**(ADDED)** sent it to a friend with a handwritten note**(REMOVED)**  encouraging**(ADDED)** , urging her to **(REMOVED)** read it**(ADDED)** dive into its pages.**(REMOVED)**   

<div class="image-row">
  <**(ADDED)** 

![John Grisham book being passed with a **(REMOVED)** href="{{ baseUrl }}**(ADDED)** handwritten note to encourage more personal and meaningful interactions](assets/images/ditch-the-scroll/sharing-books.jpg**(REMOVED)** " target="_blank" class="image-container">
    <img src="{{ baseUrl }}assets/images/ditch-the-scroll/sharing-books.jpg" alt="The Exchange**(ADDED)** )

This act of passing on a book **(REMOVED)** by John Grisham with**(ADDED)** is a **(REMOVED)** hand written note" class="inline-image">
  </a>
</div>

Why? Because books aren‚Äôt just *things*‚Äîthey‚Äôre experiences. They deserve to be passed on.  

In an era where**(ADDED)** personal, thoughtful exchange, contrasting sharply with the impersonal interactions **(REMOVED)** are reduced to**(ADDED)** of likes and comments**(REMOVED)** , handing someone a book is a rare, personal gesture**(ADDED)**  online. It**(REMOVED)** ‚Äôs an invitation**(ADDED)**  invites a return to **(REMOVED)** unplug**(ADDED)** thoughtful, **(REMOVED)** slow down, and engage with something real**(ADDED)** engaged consumption.

## **(ADDED)** Engage and Transform: Your Turn**(REMOVED)** :**(ADDED)**  to Make the Swap**(REMOVED)**   

I‚Äôm not saying *never* scroll. But I am saying **be intentional** about what you feed your mind.  

### Here‚Äôs the challenge:  

üìñ **Read instead of**(ADDED)** 

Swap scrolling**(REMOVED)** ** ‚Äì Even**(ADDED)**  for reading, even if it's just **(REMOVED)** 10**(ADDED)** for ten minutes a day. **(REMOVED)** Start**(ADDED)** Begin with small **(ADDED)** steps:

üìñ **Opt for a book over your phone.**(ADDED)** **
üéÅ **Pass along a **(REMOVED)** book you love** ‚Äì Write**(ADDED)** favorite read with a **(ADDED)** personal note.**(REMOVED)**  Make it personal.  **(ADDED)** **
üì¨ ****(REMOVED)** Got a great book? Send it my way**(ADDED)** Share what you‚Äôre reading with me!** **(REMOVED)** ‚Äì I‚Äôm always **(REMOVED)** open to my next read**(ADDED)** looking for recommendations.

**(REMOVED)**   

Your brain deserves more than an algorithm-curated feed. Give **(ADDED)** your mind the nourishment it **(ADDED)** deserves‚Äîsomething **(REMOVED)** real**(ADDED)** genuine, something enriching.
