# Introduction

Advancing in a career often **(REMOVED)** means that balancing a passion for building with strategic responsibilities becomes challenging. Time shifts **(REMOVED)** toward defining the “why” and the “what” for the team, leaving less room for the**(ADDED)** focus from hands-on **(REMOVED)** work that initially sparked interest in the field. Personal**(ADDED)** building to strategic oversight, reducing time for personal projects**(REMOVED)**  and proof-of-concepts may have**(ADDED)** . Can you relate to **(REMOVED)** wait**(ADDED)** juggling a passion for creativity with high-level responsibilities? Let me share how generative AI has revolutionized my approach, **(REMOVED)** all in**(ADDED)** enabling the **(REMOVED)** name**(ADDED)** joy of **(REMOVED)** maintaining**(ADDED)** creation despite a **(REMOVED)** healthy work-life balance**(ADDED)** tight schedule.

**(REMOVED)** Then, **(ADDED)** # Transforming Vision with AI

Generative AI tools like ChatGPT **(REMOVED)** arrived and transformed the process.

# My Passion Project**(REMOVED)** 

Traveling together has always been a shared passion between my**(ADDED)** : A Travel Itinerary Visualizer

My wife and **(REMOVED)** myself**(ADDED)** I cherish traveling, especially **(REMOVED)** when it comes to **(REMOVED)** finding exceptional hotels that offer something truly special. We’re both drawn to unique**(REMOVED)** , well-designed places, so planning our stays involves a lot of research**(ADDED)**  and aesthetically pleasing destinations. **(REMOVED)** To keep everything organized, we developed**(ADDED)** Organizing such travels began with a **(ADDED)** simple spreadsheet **(REMOVED)** that allows us to track **(REMOVED)** all the details**(ADDED)** beautiful hotels and must-visit spots. **(REMOVED)** Since we often work on it at different times**(ADDED)** This method, **(REMOVED)** the spreadsheet helps us consolidate our findings**(ADDED)** although functional, **(REMOVED)** even when one of us has information the other hasn’t seen yet.

Visualizing the entire itinerary in one place is useful when sharing with other people**(ADDED)** lacked interaction and visual appeal, **(REMOVED)** especially for a clear, big-picture view. This sparked the idea**(ADDED)** which led me to dream of **(REMOVED)** transforming the spreadsheet into something more **(REMOVED)** interactive—**(ADDED)** dynamic.

## From Spreadsheet to Interactive Map

The journey from a **(ADDED)** static spreadsheet to a lively web application started with envisioning an interactive map that could **(REMOVED)** bring**(ADDED)** embody our **(REMOVED)** plans to life**(ADDED)** itinerary visually. **(ADDED)** Instead of manually plotting each location on Google Maps**(REMOVED)**  offers custom mapping options, **(REMOVED)** but creating a map for each itinerary is time-intensive**(ADDED)** I leveraged AI to automate and **(REMOVED)** only provides location visuals. With**(ADDED)** enhance this process, turning a **(REMOVED)** [prompt] creating**(ADDED)** cumbersome task into a **(REMOVED)** rich interactive**(ADDED)** delightful experience**(REMOVED)**  was joyful and easy!

**(ADDED)** ### Building the Experience with AI
Turning to **(REMOVED)** ChatGPT**(ADDED)** generative AI for help**(REMOVED)**  made it possible to convert the spreadsheet into a dynamic travel itinerary web page, **(REMOVED)** combining both functionality and visual appeal. With just a few prompts, the spreadsheet evolved into an interactive tool that brings travel plans to life on a map. The prompt used to build the page, though simplified from a longer conversation, captures the intended outcome. Even on its own, it delivers a result that aligns with the**(ADDED)** I described my vision**(REMOVED)**  behind the planning process, **(REMOVED)** transforming a simple spreadsheet into an engaging map that enhances the travel experience.

At the end of the prompting session after retrying with a summary of all of my [prompts]({{ baseUrl }}posts/subposts/passion-projects-prompt/) the LLM did produce a similar result. This is an area where LLMs will still have some challenges, and **(REMOVED)** many companies are working on miniminzing**(ADDED)** it guided the **(REMOVED)** "hallucinations" that occur**(ADDED)** transformation. **(REMOVED)** However this output is still useful and the time to produce this was essentially one screenshot of a spreadsheet and one prompt!

# Augmenting my Skills

Creating a polished, functional web application usually requires a team of specialists and a considerable time investment. But with**(ADDED)** The AI**(REMOVED)** , the process changes entirely—bridging skill gaps and enhancing strengths, no matter where expertise lies. For instance, a great designer can use AI to handle coding, and a skilled coder can rely**(ADDED)**  took on **(REMOVED)** AI**(ADDED)** roles typically reserved for **(REMOVED)** design. AI becomes the missing piece, augmenting skills that may be less developed while allowing individuals to focus on what they do best.

In building a **(REMOVED)** travel itinerary visualizer with AI, this became clear. Traditionally, creating an app**(ADDED)** full development team:
