<h1>My Passion Project**(REMOVED)**</h1>
<p>Traveling together has always been a shared passion between my**(ADDED)** : A Travel Itinerary Visualizer</p>
<p>My wife and <strong>(REMOVED)</strong> myself**(ADDED)** I cherish traveling, especially <strong>(REMOVED)</strong> when it comes to <strong>(REMOVED)</strong> finding exceptional hotels that offer something truly special. We’re both drawn to unique**(REMOVED)** , well-designed places, so planning our stays involves a lot of research**(ADDED)**  and aesthetically pleasing destinations. <strong>(REMOVED)</strong> To keep everything organized, we developed**(ADDED)** Organizing such travels began with a <strong>(ADDED)</strong> simple spreadsheet <strong>(REMOVED)</strong> that allows us to track <strong>(REMOVED)</strong> all the details**(ADDED)** beautiful hotels and must-visit spots. <strong>(REMOVED)</strong> Since we often work on it at different times**(ADDED)** This method, <strong>(REMOVED)</strong> the spreadsheet helps us consolidate our findings**(ADDED)** although functional, <strong>(REMOVED)</strong> even when one of us has information the other hasn’t seen yet.</p>
<p>Visualizing the entire itinerary in one place is useful when sharing with other people**(ADDED)** lacked interaction and visual appeal, <strong>(REMOVED)</strong> especially for a clear, big-picture view. This sparked the idea**(ADDED)** which led me to dream of <strong>(REMOVED)</strong> transforming the spreadsheet into something more <strong>(REMOVED)</strong> interactive—<strong>(ADDED)</strong> dynamic.</p>
<h2>From Spreadsheet to Interactive Map</h2>
<p>The journey from a <strong>(ADDED)</strong> static spreadsheet to a lively web application started with envisioning an interactive map that could <strong>(REMOVED)</strong> bring**(ADDED)** embody our <strong>(REMOVED)</strong> plans to life**(ADDED)** itinerary visually. <strong>(ADDED)</strong> Instead of manually plotting each location on Google Maps**(REMOVED)**  offers custom mapping options, <strong>(REMOVED)</strong> but creating a map for each itinerary is time-intensive**(ADDED)** I leveraged AI to automate and <strong>(REMOVED)</strong> only provides location visuals.

<p><strong>(ADDED)</strong> ### Building the Experience with AI
Turning to <strong>(REMOVED)</strong> ChatGPT**(ADDED)** generative AI for help**(REMOVED)**  made it possible to convert the spreadsheet into a dynamic travel itinerary web page, <strong>(REMOVED)</strong> combining both functionality and visual appeal. With just a few prompts, the spreadsheet evolved into an interactive tool that brings travel plans to life on a map. The prompt used to build the page, though simplified from a longer conversation, captures the intended outcome. Even on its own, it delivers a result that aligns with the**(ADDED)** I described my vision**(REMOVED)**  behind the planning process, <strong>(REMOVED)</strong> transforming a simple spreadsheet into an engaging map that enhances the travel experience.</p>
<p>At the end of the prompting session after retrying with a summary of all of my <a href="/minimal-blog/posts/subposts/passion-projects-prompt/">prompts</a> the LLM did produce a similar result.
