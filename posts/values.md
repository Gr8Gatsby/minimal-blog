Focusing on self-awareness and individual values is a powerful tool for leaders and their teams when building a cohesive unit. In the hustle of daily work—juggling online meetings, instant messages, and overflowing task lists—we can easily lose sight of our core values and what truly matters.

Upon returning to Salesforce, I found myself in a new team filled with fresh faces and perspectives. Around that time, I came across Claire Hughes-Johnson's book, [Scaling People: Tactics for Management and Company Building](https://www.amazon.com/Scaling-People-Tactics-Management-Building/dp/1953953212). What resonated with me most was her focus on assessing our values and enhancing self-awareness. Inspired by her insights, I created a template for my management team, drawing also from Colin Breck's thought-provoking article. Together, we embarked on an exercise to [assess our core values](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rmp7P-qzJ6gsXrYbxMJaHS8fRhdUmrabFsoUPmEPveQ/pub).

Research supports the significance of this work. Self-awareness, especially regarding values, is crucial for effective leadership and fostering positive team dynamics. Leaders who understand their values, as well as those of their teams, pave the way for better decision-making, communication, and collaboration ([Harvard Business](https://www.harvardbusiness.org/the-ladder-of-inference-building-self-awareness-to-be-a-better-human-centered-leader/)) ([Knowledge at Wharton](https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/podcast/knowledge-at-wharton-podcast/self-awareness-key-to-more-effective-team-discussions/)). Furthermore, teams that nurture self-awareness can align individuals with meaningful work, leading to greater job satisfaction and performance ([Colin Breck](https://blog.colinbreck.com/understanding-our-core-values-an-exercise-for-individuals-and-teams/)). This exercise has its roots in this important research.

Claire's book is filled with insights, but the value-assessment activity has struck a chord with us. After a year, my leadership team revisited our values. While our core principles remained largely the same, we took the opportunity to update our work activities, celebrate our successes, and discuss the trade-offs we've navigated. This process has not only built trust but has also strengthened our team dynamic ([APA](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2018/09/cover-teams)). By understanding each team member's core values, we can align them with projects that truly fulfill and motivate them.

As you reflect on your team, I encourage you to consider the transformative impact of understanding and regularly revisiting values. How are you fostering self-awareness among your leadership and team? Remember, it’s not just about the tasks we tackle; it’s about the heart of the work we do together.
